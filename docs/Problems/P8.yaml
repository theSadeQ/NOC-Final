title: Simple constrained minimisation
objective: Minimise x1^2 + x2^2 subject to x1 >= 0, x2 >= 0, x1 + x2 >= 1
variables:
  - x ∈ ℝ^2
constraints:
  - x1 >= 0
  - x2 >= 0
  - x1 + x2 >= 1
data:
  x0_vec: [0.5; 0.5]
expected: NOT_IMPLEMENTED
tolerance: 0
solver_path: opt.barrier
gui_preset: wrappers/presets/P8.mat
notes: The barrier solver is a stub; expect status NOT_IMPLEMENTED.
